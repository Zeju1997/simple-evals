Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command.

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command.

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile.

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.

A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command.

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.

Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command.

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:

CAD code consists of a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).
