Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:
The provided code is a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

The provided code is a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:
The provided code is a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:
The provided code is a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:
The provided code is a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:
The provided code is a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:
The provided code is a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:
The provided code is a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.

Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

The provided code is a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.

A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Hint: the CAD code has the following syntax:
The provided code is a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

The provided code is a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.

The provided code is a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

The provided code is a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.

The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

The provided code is a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.

The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

The provided code is a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

The provided code is a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

The provided code is a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.

Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command.

The provided code is a sequence of CAD commands that describe a 3D object.
The commands fall into two categories: sketch and extrusion. 
Sketch commands are used to specify closed curves on a 2D plane in 3D space. Each closed curve is referred as a loop, and one or more loops form a closed region called a profile. A loop always starts with an indicator command <SOL> followed by a series of curve command. All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.

All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).

All the curves on the loop are in counterclockwise order, beginning with the curve whose starting point is at the most bottom-left.
In total, there are three possible curve commands: Line, Arc, and Circle.
Line(x, y): a line, with x, y as line end-point.
Arc(x, y, u, f): an arc, with x,y as arc end-point, u as sweep angle and f as whether it is counter-clockwise, f=0 means it is counter-clockwise, f=1 mean it is not counter-clockwise.
Circle(x, y, r): a circle, with x,y as center point and r as radius.
The extrusion command has two purposes: 1) It extrudes a sketch profile from a 2D plane into a 3D body, and the extrusion type can be either one-sided, symmetric, or two-sided with respect to the profile’s sketch plane. 2) The command also specifies (through the parameter b in Table 1) how to merge the newly extruded 3D body with the previously created shape by one of the boolean operations: either creating a new body, or joining, cutting or intersecting with the existing body.
Ext(x, y, z, o, p, q, s, e, f, b, u): extrude operation, with x, y, z as the sketch plane orientation, o, p, q as the sketch plane origin, s as the scale of associated sketch profile, e, f as the extrude distances towards both sides, b as a boolean type (could be New-body operation, joint operation, cut operation and intersect operation) and u as the extrude type (could be one-sided, symmetric or two-sided).
